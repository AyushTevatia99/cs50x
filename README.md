# CS50x 2021: Introduction to Computer Science
This repository contains my solutions for all labs and problem sets in <a href='https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science'>CS50 2021 course on edX</a>. I don't finish the course yet, so the solutions will keep being updated as I follow the course.  <br><br>
You can find all the course's lectures <a href='https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/'>here</a>. Also you can find all the labs and problems sets' spesifications and walkthrough there. <br><br>
For your attention, not all the solutions scored 100% on submission,as you can see below, but all of them are 70% above, so I still can get the certificate. :) <br><br>
Remember not to just copy and paste the solution, because that breaks the [**Academic Honesty**](https://docs.cs50.net/2016/fall/syllabus/cs50.html#academic-honesty) policy of the course. You must try it by yourself first so you can get the point. Otherwise, it will be meaningless though you get the certificate. <br><br>
Lastly, I hope this can help other students and please leave a star if so! :) <br><br>
